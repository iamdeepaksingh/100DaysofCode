## STEP 1: Use https://newsapi.org/docs/endpoints/everything
# When STOCK price increase/decreases by 5% between yesterday and the day before yesterday then print("Get News").
#HINT 1: Get the closing price for yesterday and the day before yesterday. Find the positive difference between the two prices. e.g. 40 - 20 = -20, but the positive difference is 20.
#HINT 2: Work out the value of 5% of yerstday's closing stock price. 

NEWS_PARAM = {
    "q": "COMPANY_NAME",
    "from": "2022-02-03",

}

#response1 = requests.get(url="https://newsapi.org/v2/everything", params=NEWS_PARAM)
#response1.raise_for_status()

#data1 = response1.json()
#print(data)

## STEP 2: Use https://newsapi.org/docs/endpoints/everything
# Instead of printing ("Get News"), actually fetch the first 3 articles for the COMPANY_NAME. 
#HINT 1: Think about using the Python Slice Operator



## STEP 3: Use twilio.com/docs/sms/quickstart/python
# Send a separate message with each article's title and description to your phone number. 
#HINT 1: Consider using a List Comprehension.

#print(news_data)

for i in news_data:

    print(i["description"])
    print("\n")

#Optional: Format the SMS message like this:
